# Decisions

Major choices, newest last. Each says what we decided, why, what else we considered and what it
implies. "Founding chat" = the ChatGPT brainstorm that seeded the project (docs/FOUNDING.md).

### D1 — Native Swift app instead of Tauri/web (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** Swift 6 (AppKit shell, SwiftUI views, Core Animation character), SwiftPM, macOS 15+.
**Why:** an always-visible companion must cost ~0% CPU idle; Core Animation animations run in the
render server, while the legacy WebKit overlay needed extensive work to get to a few percent.
Native panels give correct focus/Spaces/fullscreen behaviour, Keychain, notifications, login item.
**Alternatives:** Tauri + WebGL (legacy), Electron, SwiftUI-only animation (per-frame CPU).
**Implications:** no Windows/Linux; UI work happens in Swift.

### D2 — Vector character rig on Core Animation, not sprites or 3D (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** the approved character is rebuilt as layered vector shapes (gradients, shadows as
glow) with pose-to-pose spring transitions and morphing eyes.
**Why:** smooth state transitions instead of swapping GIFs, crisp at every size, reduced-motion
friendly, extension folks are data, near-zero idle CPU. AI image generation cannot produce
consistent animation frames; a Blender pipeline is slower to iterate.
**Implications:** the look approximates the soft-3D renders; a pre-rendered body is a later upgrade path.

### D3 — The robot keeps the name "Sidefolk"; Pip is the coral folk (2026-10-26)
**Why:** the founder's approved identity sheet labels the main character "Sidefolk" and Pip as the
Ideas & Notes folk. The legacy app (where Pip was the main character) was intentionally wiped.
The name is editable in Settings; onboarding does not ask for it.

### D4 — Plain-language understanding is local first; AI is for what needs reasoning (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** a deterministic intent parser understands reminders, notes, watches, quiet mode and
search in plain language ("remind me in 20 min to call mom") and completes them in milliseconds
without a model. The input shows a hint line saying what Enter will do and whether it uses AI.
**Why:** founding chat ("remind me at 5 → no LLM needed"), cost (users spend quota by accident),
speed (CLI brains take seconds to start), offline use. **Alternatives:** slash commands only
(too rigid), everything through the model (slow, costly).

### D5 — The Ask panel shows results, not a transcript (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** every request ends in a card (saved note, reminder, watch, answer, approval). Short
history is kept for follow-ups (10-minute thread window) but not displayed as a chat log.
**Why:** product review: a transcript makes Sidefolk "a chat app with a mascot".

### D6 — Memories fold into the Notebook as "About you" (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** no separate memory store. Durable facts/preferences are notes in a pinned profile
collection that is always offered to the model (within budget).
**Why:** users cannot tell a memory from a note; one visible, editable place builds trust.
**Alternatives:** separate memory table (founding chat's taxonomy), vector memory.

### D7 — No vector database in V1 (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** SQLite FTS5 (porter stemming, bm25) plus recency and collection scoping feed a
budgeted context package. **Why:** small personal corpora, explainable retrieval, no model needed
to index. Embeddings are a post-V1 option behind the same retrieval interface.

### D8 — Brains: Claude Code CLI, Anthropic API, OpenAI-compatible; one model + "Think harder" (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** the Claude Code CLI can be the brain using the user's subscription, launched with
`--tools ""` (no built-in tools), an isolated working folder and settings, and only Sidefolk tools
via the local MCP bridge, so every action still passes Guard. API backends share one tool loop.
Each provider has a main model and an optional "smart" model used by "Think harder".
**Why:** the founder has Claude Code; API keys are optional. The founding chat's automatic
multi-tier router is replaced by a simpler, explainable rule. Apple's on-device model was
`modelNotReady` on the dev machine, so it is post-V1. D26 adds Codex and provider presets.

### D9 — Folks are "on duty" markers, not cameos on every action (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** Tempo (reminder due within 15 min), Scout (watchers active) and Byte (agent session
or job running) sit beside the companion while their job is live, at most three, and never speak.
Guard appears as the badge on approval cards. In the Home window each domain uses its folk as
accent. **Why:** cameos on every action duplicate the robot's props and become noise.

### D10 — Presence modes (2026-10-26)
Always / Only when needed (a small peek until something needs you) / Menu bar only. The first
complaint about a desktop companion is "it's always there".

### D11 — Hotkey ⌘⇧Space (2026-10-26)
⌥Space (founding chat) is taken by Raycast/Alfred/ChatGPT on many machines.

### D12 — Agents can reach Sidefolk: MCP bridge, `sidefolk run`, Claude Code hooks (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** `sidefolk mcp` exposes notes, reminders, watches, notify and ask to any MCP client;
`sidefolk run -- <cmd>` runs a command and tells you when it ends (nobody knows PIDs); optional
Claude Code hooks (installed only on the user's click, with a backup) let the companion notice
when a session needs you or finished. **Why:** the founding chat's strongest differentiator
("watch this Codex session, tell me when it needs me") and the main daily use for the founder.

### D13 — Extensions are MCP-speaking executables with a Sidefolk manifest (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** an extension = folder + `sidefolk-extension.json` (permissions, tool risk, watchers,
folk) + an executable speaking MCP over stdio, run under a `sandbox-exec` profile generated from
its permissions. Plain MCP servers can be added too; they run unsandboxed, clearly labelled, and
their tools default to medium risk. **Why:** reuse the MCP ecosystem instead of inventing an RPC
protocol, yet keep manifests, permissions and failure isolation that the product requires.
**Alternatives:** MCP only (no permission model), in-process plugins (no isolation), JavaScript
runtime (heavy). `sandbox-exec` is deprecated but is what Claude Code and Codex use on macOS.

### D14 — Guard is deterministic and outside the model (2026-10-26)
Risk levels, caller trust, taint from untrusted content, folder grants, protected paths, exact-
command grants for shell, approvals answered only by the user. Founding chat's "the AI should
never decide its own permission" taken literally.

### D15 — No auto-update in V1 (2026-10-26)
Sparkle needs a signing identity, EdDSA keys and a hosted feed, none of which exist yet. Shipping a
"Check for updates" that cannot work would be a fake feature. Data migrations are versioned so a
later update path is safe.

### D16 — Agent integrations edit the config files directly, with confirmation and backup (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** connecting Claude Code / Codex edits `~/.claude.json`, `~/.claude/settings.json` and
`~/.codex/config.toml` directly (ordered JSON / TOML section edit, timestamped backup beside the file,
atomic replace, exact removal) instead of shelling out to `claude mcp add`. Only on the user's click,
after a dialog that lists every change and the backup path.
**Why:** predictable and testable, no CLI on PATH needed, same backup/removal semantics everywhere.

### D17 — Proprietary license until the founder decides (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** LICENSE reserves all rights. Dependencies (GRDB, KeyboardShortcuts) are MIT and listed in
THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md (bundled in the app). Choosing an open-source license later is a one-file change;
choosing one tonight would be irreversible for the founder.

### D18 — Test suite runs serially by default (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** `make test` and `release.sh` use `swift test --no-parallel` (~25 s). Under parallel
execution a few process-spawning integration tests occasionally fail because freshly written fixture
executables stall at launch under heavy contention; serial runs are reliable. Production spawning was
hardened anyway (spawn lock, close-on-exec pipes, ETXTBSY retry, probe retry).

### D19 — Extension watchers run through one "extension" probe kind (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** the watcher engine knows one generic kind that calls an extension's `sidefolk/watch.check`;
`watch.extension` (medium risk) starts them, validated against the manifest's config fields, never louder
than "attention". The agent sees available extension watchers in its context.

### D20 — The companion settles when nothing is happening (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** idle, listening and sleeping breathe for 20 s after any change, then hold still (blinks
continue); busy states keep moving. Loops are capped at ~24 fps, the body layer is rasterized, and
all loops pause while the window is hidden or covered.
**Why:** the performance review measured the endless breathing loop costing ~43% of a core in
WindowServer on a 120 Hz display (app CPU itself was 0.08%). Motion is information; constant motion
is noise and battery.

### D21 — Local addresses can be watched when the user asks (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** `watch.create` from the user's own request (`Caller.user`, untainted) may target
localhost, LAN and `.local` hosts ("tell me when localhost:3000 is up"). Agents, external clients,
extensions and tainted turns are still refused (SECURITY T11), with a message that says to ask
directly. **Why:** the developer persona's main watch target is a local server; the SSRF guard is
about model-built URLs, not the user's own words.

### D22 — Agents' questions are answered in the Ask panel; bubbles keep their buttons (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** Sidefolk's own agent (and external questions without options) asks inside the Ask panel,
where the user can pick an option or type an answer; `ask.user` accepts free-text answers. Bubbles
never lose their action buttons when they shrink, and questions never shrink. **Why:** the UX review
found unanswerable collapsed bubbles and a two-minute clarification ping-pong.

### D23 — `sidefolk run` tees stderr so failures can say what went wrong (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** the helper keeps stdin and stdout the caller's own, but passes stderr through a tee: a
pseudo-terminal with the caller's terminal settings and size when stderr is a terminal (so colours and
progress bars still work; output processing is off so bytes pass untouched), a pipe otherwise. Only on a
non-zero exit do the last three lines, cleaned of escape codes, go to the app. They are shown to the
user and never given to a model. **Why:** "npm test failed (exit 1)" is not actionable; the last
error line usually is. **Trade-off:** something the command leaves running in the background loses its
stderr when `sidefolk run` returns (it waits half a second for it).

### D24 — Extension tool descriptions never reach the model (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** the model sees an extension tool as a neutral line (its title, which extension, its risk)
and an input schema with free text removed, not the author's description. **Why:** a description is
text written by a third party and loaded into every run; tainting every run instead would make every
link and memory write ask for approval. Tool names and titles (60 characters at most) remain a small
residual channel (SECURITY T2).

### D25 — Reference-faithful production brand assets (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** use standalone transparent artwork reconstructed from the founder's Folk Family
reference for static logos and the macOS app icon. Preserve the original flat wordmark's letter
silhouettes as smooth fitted Bézier outlines, with navy/aqua fills and no generated text effects.
Export a complete ICNS/iconset and native 18 pt vector menu bar template; bundle production exports
and load them through `BrandAsset`. The menu template simplifies the companion's shell/visor/smile
for small sizes and lets macOS tint its alpha. The live vector rig remains as specified in D2.
**Why:** the identity must match the approved reference and work as real framework assets, rather
than mockups, a presentation sheet, or enlarged low-resolution crops. The deterministic
`make brand-assets` pipeline rebuilds each file from committed inputs without another model call.

### D26 — Every main provider, chosen by how you pay; Codex isolated like Claude Code (2026-10-26)
**Decision:** add Codex (`codex exec`) as a brain on the user's ChatGPT plan, beside Claude Code,
and keep one OpenAI-compatible transport with presets: OpenAI, Google Gemini (its OpenAI-compatible
endpoint), Mistral, Groq, xAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio and a custom address. Each
preset knows its address, whether a key is needed, where to get one, and how to list models; its
key has its own Keychain account bound to its host. Settings › AI groups the choices by how you pay
(a plan you already have, an API key, this Mac, your own server, no AI), shows each one's state
(found, signed in, key saved, running) and the exact next step (a link, or a command to copy), and
opens the chosen one's setup in place. Model lists come from the provider; the first suggested
model it actually offers becomes the default. Each provider keeps its own model when you switch.
"Test" sends one tiny real request through the same path as a question.
**Why:** the founder pays for ChatGPT and uses Codex, and wants setup easy for everyone. Presets
remove the base-URL guesswork that caused the Gemini bug ("models/…" ids, array-wrapped errors)
without a second transport. Model names go stale, so suggestions are checked against the
provider's own list rather than hard-coded as the only choice. A free `/models` lookup isn't a test:
only a real request proves a question will work.
**Why the CLIs are isolated this way:** a subscription CLI is a general coding agent with a shell,
file edits, a browser and plugins, running as the user; Sidefolk's brain must only act through
Sidefolk's tools so Guard sees every action (D14). Claude Code reports its tools at start, so the
run is checked there. Codex doesn't, so every Codex feature that's on by default is switched off
except the plumbing the brain needs (later features included), its config, rules and folder
instructions are ignored, it runs read-only with approvals off in a private folder, and the event
stream is watched: anything that isn't a message or a Sidefolk tool call stops the run, and what
the switches should have prevented also disables the backend until restart (SECURITY T7).
**Alternatives:** Codex through its app-server protocol (more surface, same tools to switch off);
a separate `CODEX_HOME` (loses the user's sign-in); one Keychain account for every
OpenAI-compatible service (each switch would need the key again); hard-coded model lists.
**Implications:** Codex adds the user's own global `AGENTS.md` and keeps `apply_patch` offered to
its own models; neither can act (read-only sandbox, approvals off, events watched) but they're
documented residuals. New Codex versions are probed (flags and feature names) before use.
